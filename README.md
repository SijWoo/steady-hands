# Introduction
This repo contains the src files and hardware for a wearable wrist band that treats chronic shaky hands.

## Background
Tremors make your hands or other parts of your body involuntarily move and shake. Severe cases can even make everday tasks difficult. This device is to let people from mild to severe cases regain control through the use of vibration feedback.

## How it works
Overloading the sensory nerves can surpress the involuntary movement. Vibration motors are implemented inside the wearable to constantly stimulate the nerves.
